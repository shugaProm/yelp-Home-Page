# yelp-Home-Page
Hands on practice of pure HTML and CSS only

A front-end development. The home page of the yelp official website with 100% HTML and CSS.
I did this project to strengthen & stiffen my HTML and CSS skills.

It goes on to deliver a well presented and aesthetically finished yelp website home page designed with only html and css.
No Bootstrap, no front-end framework.
